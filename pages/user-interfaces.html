Coq projects can be developed with a variety of editors thanks to
great support provided through user-contributed extensions.  Here, we
list such support extensions that are actively used and maintained:

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> and <strong>VSCodium</strong> users can use either of
the <a href="https://github.com/coq-community/vscoq">VsCoq
extension</a>, which is actively maintained by several contributors as part
of <a href="https://github.com/coq-community/manifesto">coq-community</a>, or
the new <a href="https://github.com/ejgallego/coq-lsp">coq-lsp extension</a>,
which is based on an implementation of the <a
href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol">Language
Server Protocol</a> standard, with custom extensions.

<tt>coq-lsp</tt> provides continous document checking and position-based
document navigation (an interaction model similar to what is found in e.g.,
Lean, and which departs from the model found in other Coq user interfaces).
See <tt>coq-lsp's</tt> <a
href="https://github.com/ejgallego/coq-lsp/blob/main/etc/FAQ.md">FAQ</a>
for more information.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Emacs</strong> users can use the major Coq
mode <a href="https://proofgeneral.github.io/">Proof General</a>, that
can be extended by the minor Coq
mode <a href="https://github.com/cpitclaudel/company-coq">Company-Coq</a>.
Proof General was one of the first user interface for proof
assistants, and is one of the most used user interface for Coq today.
Proof General and Company-Coq give access to many productivity
shortcuts, including auto-completion and documentation.  On the other
hand, async proof processing is not supported.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Vim/NeoVim</strong> users can use the actively
maintained <a href="https://github.com/whonore/Coqtail">Coqtail</a>
extension.  This extension is partly based upon a previous, and now
unmaintained, Vim extension
called <a href="https://github.com/the-lambda-church/coquille">Coquille</a>.
</li>

</ul>

</p>

<p>
An experimental alternative to the editors mentioned above is the
computational notebook interface provided by Jupyter.
A <a href="https://github.com/EugeneLoy/coq_jupyter/">Jupyter kernel
for Coq</a> is available if you want to try this interface, for
instance for pedagogical or readability purposes.  One of the
advantages of using a Jupyter notebook is that you can save and
display a selection of intermediate proof steps, which your reader
will see without the need to reexecute the document.

Alternatively, you can
use <a href="https://coq.inria.fr/refman/practical-tools/coqide.html">CoqIDE</a>,
which is developed and distributed alongside Coq. CoqIDE relies
on <a href="https://github.com/coq/coq/blob/master/dev/doc/xml-protocol.md">Coq's
XML protocol for IDEs</a> and implements all of the features provided
by this protocol, meaning in particular asynchronous evaluation.
CoqIDE comes with standard basic Emacs-like bindings
and with some specific Coq-related bindings but, as an editor, it is
not as complete as a general-purpose editor could be (for instance it
does not have automatic indentation).
</p>

<p>
As a way to try Coq without installing anything, you can
use <a href="https://jscoq.github.io/">JsCoq</a>.  JsCoq loads Coq
entirely in your browser.  However, it is too limited to conduct
actual projects: it lacks access to the VM and native computing
machineries of Coq, and may hit out-of-memory and stack-overflow
failures quicker than native versions of Coq.

There have been many experiments over the years.  Here are some
additional user interfaces that have stayed at the experimental level
or whose maintenance has been discontinued and or is currently
uncertain:
<ul>
<li>
The <a href="http://coqoon.github.io/">Coqoon</a> Eclipse plugin was
initially based upon
the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/coqpide/pidetop/src/PIDEtop/">PIDEtop
Coq plugin</a> (following Wenzel's asynchronous PIDE framework).
Support for more recent versions of Coq (8.7 and 8.8) relies
on <a href="https://github.com/coq/coq/blob/master/dev/doc/xml-protocol.md">Coq's
XML protocol for IDEs</a>.
</li>
<li>
The <a href="https://github.com/Ptival/PeaCoq">PeaCoq</a> online web
interface for Coq was focused on teaching (actively developed from
2014 to 2016).
</li>
<li>
The <a href="http://prover.cs.ru.nl">ProofWeb</a> online web interface
for Coq (and other proof assistants) was also focused on teaching (in
2006-2007).
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://provereditor.gforge.inria.fr">ProverEditor</a> was an
experimental Eclipse plugin with support for Coq (in 2005-2006).
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www-sop.inria.fr/lemme/pcoq/">Pcoq</a> (discontinued
in 2003) was a first experiment at <a href="https://www-sop.inria.fr/croap/ctcoq/help/pbp.html">proof-by-pointing</a>.
</ul>
